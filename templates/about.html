    <h1>About Story Prompter</h1>
    
    <p>At <a href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/story-hack-boston"> Story Hack Boston 2012</a>, we were faced with a Record button and nothing to talk about. Brian was inspired by his young daughter Zoe's persistent request for the same bedtime story. How about a tool for inspiring a new story that she would find interesting, and he could riff on spontaneously? That's how the Fable story type came to be.</p> 
    
    <p>Glenn and Erin offered ideas for more ways to inspire a story from grownups, in the manner of NPR's <a href="http://www.npr.org/series/4516989/storycorps">StoryCorps</a>. So we added Personal stories, and News to encourage commentary on current events. The "Madlibs" scheme for assembling prompts is extensible and we encourage suggestions for additions. You'll find the project at <a href="https://github.com/BDFife/StoryPrompter">StoryPrompter</a>.</p>
    
    <p>We're not accumulating stories for a public page. Our thought is to give you a tool to use to capture your own family's voices to your personal SoundCloud account. You can see a list of stories generated by searching for the soundcloud tag "storyprompter"</p>
    
    <p>The SoundHack event was sponsored by <a href="http://SoundCloud.com"> SoundCloud</a> and <a href="http://www.mashery.com">The Mashery</a>, so we used the SoundCloud API to present the Record button and news stories from USA Today using a demo API account The Mashery provided for the event.</p>
    
    <p>Of course, after all that work, Zoe still wants to hear the same familiar story, but we know she'll grow out of it someday!</p>
